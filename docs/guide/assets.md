# Assets

Since version R2022b, all the Webots assets are provided and documented on [webots.cloud](https://webots.cloud/proto).
A keyword-based search is available so that you can explore them easily.
Any user can contribute their own assets to [webots.cloud](https://webots.cloud/proto) by hosting them on a public [GitHub](https://github.com) repository and registering them on [webots.cloud](https://webots.cloud/proto) by pressing the "Add a new proto" button located at the bottom of the page.
In addition to standard objects, like chairs, flower pots, etc., they include some particular categories:
